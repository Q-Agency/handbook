Mason is a Dart template generator which enable users to generate files and directories based on templates quickly and consistently. These reusable templates are called bricks. A brick can be a file or a collection of nested files and directories.\
We made couple of bricks which help us to quickly start adding new feature to the project and also bricks to make adding various third party packages easier. In the next chapter we will go in more details into generate feature bricks (**model**, **repository**, **entity** and **notifier**) and here we will mention the other bricks in our library:
